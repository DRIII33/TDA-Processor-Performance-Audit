## **Portfolio Project Disclaimer**
**Project Title:** Portfolio Project II: TDA Processor Performance and Drawdown Efficiency Audit

This disclaimer accompanies the portfolio project submitted for consideration for the **TDA - F\&N - Food Distribution Specialist - Level 1 (Data Analyst) (56976) (00054076)** role at the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA).

* **Purpose and Alignment:** This project was developed solely for demonstrative purposes to showcase data analysis, visualization, and SQL/Python proficiency that aligns directly with the duties outlined in the job posting—specifically, the responsibility to analyze and evaluate Processor Monthly Performance Reports (MPR) data for compliance and performance.
* **Data and Research Basis:** The project employs the **CRISP-DM framework** to simulate an end-to-end analytical workflow. The scenario, including the establishment of the Drawdown Performance Index (DPI) and the identification of risks like high-volume inventory bottlenecks, was informed by general public information and common operational challenges observed within large-scale government food distribution and supply chain programs.
* **Synthetic Data:** **All data used in this project is entirely synthetic, fabricated, and generated algorithmically** (e.g., in Google Colab using Python). The processors (e.g., PROC\_61001), report metrics, and compliance failures are fictional and were created to generate realistic data volatility and demonstrate analytical capability.
* **Public Information:** Any factual information regarding the Texas Department of Agriculture, its Food and Nutrition division, or the USDA Foods program referenced herein is based only on publicly available documentation, press releases, and general knowledge regarding federal nutrition programs.
* **No Misrepresentation:** This portfolio project does **not** use, contain, or reflect any confidential, proprietary, or non-public data from the TDA or any third-party processor or Contracted Entity. The project does not intend to misrepresent the performance, compliance, or operational status of any specific company, entity, or agency mentioned in the project context.
